6.1:
  To use the different methods. you'll have to specifically go in tot he file, and comment out and in the methods you want to use.

For 6.4:
The plotting of the result is missing, and since the plot figure is missing, the hmtl file can't output the picture.
I have not implemented "• y-axis min, max" for this part. It is a easy fix. I would just do the same if test as i did in plot_temperature() and plot_co2().
  The output list would then have tuples with two elements, [0]=country name and [1]=list of values(with different length, hence to • y-axis min, max)
  
Other than that:
The code it self in temperature__CO2_plotter can read and find the correct results with start year and end year.
The Flask and HTML is made and ready to output the picture. But since there are none, the page will crash.
